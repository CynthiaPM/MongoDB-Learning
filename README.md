# Introduction to MongoDB Basics

Welcome to the MongoDB Basics Learning Journey! This README provides an overview of my introduction to MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, during the initial weeks of the IT Academy.

## Learning Focus

In this phase of my IT Academy training, I gained a fundamental understanding of MongoDB, focusing on the following key aspects:

- **NoSQL Databases:** Learned about the concept of NoSQL databases and their advantages compared to traditional relational databases.
- **MongoDB Installation:** Set up and configured MongoDB on my local machine to start working with databases.
- **Document-Oriented Model:** Explored MongoDB's document-oriented approach, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- **Basic Operations:** Practiced inserting documents into collections, querying data, and updating documents using simple MongoDB commands.
- **Query Language:** Gained insights into the MongoDB query language and basic query operators.

## Practical Application

During this learning journey, I engaged in hands-on exercises to apply my MongoDB knowledge:

- **Document Insertion:** Created and inserted simple documents into collections to understand the structure.
- **Query Practice:** Crafted basic queries to retrieve specific data from collections.
- **Updating Documents:** Learned to update fields within documents using MongoDB commands.

## How to Use

To explore the MongoDB Basics Learning Journey:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a MongoDB server on your computer or use an online platform.
3. Access the MongoDB shell or use a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass.
4. Experiment with inserting documents, querying data, and updating documents.
5. Review the provided MongoDB files to understand the basic operations performed.
6. Explore the code and experiment with basic MongoDB queries and data manipulations.

## Acknowledgements

This learning experience marked my initial steps into MongoDB, providing essential insights into NoSQL databases and MongoDB's approach to data storage.
